I'm an iOS developer based in Portland, specializing in building high-performance, scalable applications. I currently work on the Point of Sale iOS application for Heartland Payment Systems, where I focus on integrating payment solutions, optimizing POS workflows, and maintaining a seamless user experience.

With a strong background in both **Swift and Objective-C**, I enjoy designing modular, testable architectures that enhance maintainability. My experience includes working with **asynchronous programming (async/await), Combine, UIKit/SwiftUI, and various networking protocols**, as well as shell-scripting and managing CI/CD pipelines using Xcode Cloud.

Beyond work, I'm passionate about exploring new technologies, refining development processes, and solving complex problems. In my free time, I enjoy **golf, skating, snowboarding, and music**.

Feel free to check out my projects and reach out if you'd like to connect!
