I'm an iOS developer based in San Diego, available to work remotely or within San Diego.

I have a particular focus in Firebase, Augmented Reality, CoreLocation, and the MVC architectural pattern.

Projects I've completed:

* [Sample San Diego Zoo App](https://wdesimini.github.io/sanDiegoZooAppSample/) (personal project)
* [Thanks for the Invite!](https://tftiapplication.wordpress.com/) (personal project, available in the App Store)
