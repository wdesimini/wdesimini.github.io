EQ Trainer plays frequency bands using either Sine waves or Pink Noise to train your mixing ear and recognize specific frequencies in a mix. Users are able to track their skills through statistics as well as configure settings to more effectively practice and improve.

Libraries I used:
- [Macaw](https://github.com/exyte/Macaw) for animated statistics graph
- [AVFoundation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation) for Sine wave generator
- [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit) for UI/controls
